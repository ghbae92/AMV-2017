## System Description

### Micro Controller Unit
* infineon embedded board TC23x
- 32-bit scalar TriCoreâ„¢ CPU running at up to 200 MHz
- Up to 2 MB Flash and 192KB RAM

### Implementation
* This project written in C language.
- No external libraries were used to implement the vehicle controller program and the image processing program.

### Topics
#### Image processing
- Image processing application based on numerical analysis. (noise filtering, edge detecting, machine vision...)
#### Vehicle dynamics
- Dynamic modelling for analysis of vehicle driving.
#### Control engineering
- Longitudinal and lateral control of vehicle.
#### Application
- Path finding and avoidance of obstacles based on computer vision.
#### Embedded system programming
- Forward and backward scheduling.
- Using hardware components (e.g camera, dc-motor, servomotor, dms...)
